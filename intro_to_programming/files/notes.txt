Opening Files

We open an existing file using File.open. We will pass the file name and a second argument which will decide how the file will be opened. Usually, the following are used:

r: read-only (starts at beginning of file)
w: write-only (if the file exists, overwrites everything in the file)
w+: read and write (if the file exists, overwrites everything in the file)
a+: read-write (if file exists, starts at end of file. Otherwise creates a new file). Suitable for updating files.

Open File For Reading

Reading file contents is easy in Ruby. Here are two options:

File.read("file_name") - Spits out entire contents of the file.
File.readlines("file_name") - Reads the entire file based on individual lines and returns those lines in an array.
